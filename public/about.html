<h2><p>Hello!<br />
   <br />
   I am new to coding and this is one of the first projects I am working on.  The goal is to make an HTML webpage that relates to me and my projects.
   This will be a work in progress, so please do not mind the mess.  As I practice more, I will get better at building more stylish pages.<br /> 
   <br />
   Thank you for stopping by!</p></h2>
